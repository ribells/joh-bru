Johanna's week 4 notes:
-----------------------------

Choose a specific time of year, with a specific situation in terms of vegetation (crops or otherwise)
Determine how the precipitation varies based on elevation (this can be a basic formula we use until we actual data)

Update the code to use just a portion of the .asc area coverage

We will begin to study how irrigation works within an area (and figure out what formulas we need to add to the model computation)
